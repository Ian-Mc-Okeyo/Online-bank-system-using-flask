# Online-bank-system-using-flask
Creating an online bank system using flask. Users can manage their bank account from the web, including loans.
In this project we create a bank management system. Users visit the bank to have their accounts created. This uses a desktop app locally for the bank. This desktop app
has higher privileges. Everythin that can be done from the website can be done in this desktop app.
For the website, users can only manage their personal bank accounts.
There is also a forex system. Users can check forex rates from the website.
